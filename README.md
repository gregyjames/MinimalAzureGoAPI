# MinimalAzureGoAPI ðŸš€
This project is a minimal template repository intended to be a starting point when developing API applications in Go. It speeds up the process by simplifying some of the trivial tasks involved such as writing Dockerfiles or setting up Github Actions from scratch. 

## Getting Started

| Name | Description  |
|--|--|
| REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER | Registry name in all lowercase. |
| REGISTRY_USERNAME||
| REGISTRY_PASSWORD | |
| REGISTRY_NAME | The name of the registry to push to.|

## Features

 1. Deploy, Build and Dependabot actions preconfigured.
 2. Minimum Fiber API with compression already configured.
 3. Tiny Docker container built using scratch image and UPX compression with a size of approximately 2MB.
